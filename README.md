# RefStressMapCombined
Combines 8 categories of ref and stress into 3

This script was built using R 4.0.2 (Taking Off Again). This markdown document contains the biologists comments/additional data review that enabled VDEQ to collapse the 
8 categories (bestref, goodref, goodmodref, lowest stress, low stress, mod2stress, modstress, highest stress)  into 3 categories (reference = ref, intermediate = int, stress=str). In 
this version of the document,all sites have been reviewed by the biologist(s) and all "ref-pied" - have been identified. These are the site the biologist think are the best available 
sites in the piedmont of Virginia for where the sites are located. This version includes West Virginia DEP reference and stress sites in the Central Appalachians now.
